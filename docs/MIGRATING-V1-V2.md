# Migrating `wix-ui-tpa` from v1 to v2

Since version 2.0.0 of `wix-ui-tpa` it uses stylable version 3. Even
though it's an internal dependency upgrade it is likely to require
changes on consumer side.

If your project uses stylable version 1, it will not be compatible with `wix-ui-tpa`.

To fix this, you will need to migrate your project to use stylable version 3 as well.
